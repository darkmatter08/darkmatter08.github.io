### Previous Collaborators

I worked with [Ken Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Stanley) and [Joel Lehman](http://joellehman.com/) at OpenAI on Open-Ended algorithms. I contributed to the [Evolution through Large Models (ELM) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08896).

I was mentored by [Greg Yang](https://github.com/thegregyang) at Microsoft Research on general purpose methods for efficient training and inference in NNs via approximate tensor operations. I am increasingly interested in genetic algorithms and feedback alignment -- alternatives to backprop.

I worked with [Hamid Palangi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hpalangi/) and [Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/), investigating [Transformer models' temporal reasoning ability](pages/blog-transformers-poster.html).

At Uber ATG (now [Aurora](https://aurora.tech/)) I worked with a bunch of people on perception, localization, calibration, and lidar.

I was advised by [Antonio Torralba](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/torralbalab/) at MIT, and worked closely with PhD candidate [Xavi Puig](https://www.xavierpuigf.com/) (now at FAIR).

I interned at Google Fiber (2014) where I worked with [Denny Gentry](https://codingrelic.geekhold.com/) and [Avery Pennarun](https://apenwarr.ca/log/).

[George Hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) offered me an intership one time.
