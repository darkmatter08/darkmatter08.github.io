### Tools

Inevitably someone will ask me about my 'coding setup.' For development, I typically use Visual Studio Code with the [Remote Development Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). This setup allows me to work fairly seamlessly on any machine I can ssh into. This means I don't have to fiddle with sshfs or similar to get things working. 

Before VSCode, I used Sublime Text for nearly 8 years.

My favorite debugging tool is [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb).
